# Robo-Advisor-ML-project

Financial Product

We'll focus on building a Robo-Advisor with Predictive Capabilities â€” a personalized financial assistant that recommends investment strategies, predicts portfolio performance, and automates portfolio rebalancing.

Project: RoboAdvisorML â€” Intelligent Investment Assistant
Main Features:

User profiling based on age, income, goals, and risk tolerance.

Portfolio recommendations using Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) + ML enhancements.

Forecast asset performance using time-series models.

Explainable model outputs (risk metrics, performance scenarios).

Rebalancing strategies using Reinforcement Learning or threshold-based rules.


Core ML Components:

Module	Task	Algorithms
User Segmentation	Cluster investors by profile	K-Means, GMM, DBSCAN
Portfolio Construction	Allocate assets	MPT, Hierarchical Risk Parity, Ridge Regression
Asset Prediction	Forecast returns/prices	LSTM, Prophet, ARIMA, TFT
Rebalancing Engine	Automate portfolio adjustments	Q-learning, PPO (RL), heuristic rules
NLP Module (optional)	Analyze news/earnings reports	FinBERT, summarization models

Roadmap: Step-by-Step
ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: Problem Scoping & Planning
Define user personas (e.g., conservative, moderate, aggressive investors).

Define product outcome (e.g., recommend 3 portfolios with risk ratings).

Specify UI/UX mockups or dashboard layout (optional).

ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: Data Collection & Preprocessing
Use yfinance or Alpha Vantage to pull daily prices of stocks, ETFs, bonds.

Normalize and clean data: handle missing prices, split-adjustments, and outliers.

Join macroeconomic indicators (FRED) to enrich input features.

Optional: Create sentiment scores from earnings calls or news.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 3: Modeling
Portfolio Allocation: Use historical mean-variance optimization.

Prediction:

Time-series forecasting for asset returns (LSTM, ARIMA).

Scenario generation (Monte Carlo simulations).

User Clustering: Segment users by financial profile.

Recommendation System: Match portfolios to user segments.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 4: Evaluation & Explainability
Backtest strategies using rolling windows.

Evaluate with Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, max drawdown, ROI.

Use SHAP/LIME for explaining asset allocation choices.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 5: UI and Deployment
Build frontend using Streamlit, Dash, or React.

Backend: Flask/FastAPI for model serving.

Host on AWS/GCP/Streamlit Cloud or local server.

ðŸ”¹ Phase 6: Feedback & Continuous Learning
Simulate new users and test model updates.

Use logs to improve personalization over time.

Add a feedback loop for retraining (MLOps).

Optional Enhancements:

Voice-enabled portfolio advice (speech recognition â†’ NLP â†’ recommendation).

ESG scoring from text-based news or reports using transformer models.
